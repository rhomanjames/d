            <p>Fayette County Public Schools closed in March of 2020, and didn't allow students back in schools for almost an entire year later.</p>

            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p><b>Fayette County Public Schools faced a crisis. </b>Angry parents yelled at the county board meetings and demanded the kids go back to school after the students had been home for months due to COVID-19. <b>Teachers were afraid to go into school, fearing they would get COVID-19 from fellow teachers.</b> Parents didnt want to send their kids to school, with the fear of getting COVID-19 from students or other teachers. Reporting directly to the Superintendent, <b>I created and implemented a contact tracing system for employees with a companion, QR-code based mobile app.</b> This is one instance where UX extended beyond the screen, <b></b>it helped save lives, reduce the spread of COVID-19 and keep our 50+ schools open.</p>

            <h1>Strategy</h1>
            <p>We needed to <b>use a no-code app builder to build a QR-code based mobile app rapidly.</b> This would allow people to quickly scan in and out of classrooms, <b>creating a database for school leaders to use for rapid, contact tracing.</b> QR codes would be specific to each school, and would need to be placed outside of classrooms that were frequently entered. </b></p>

            <h1>Challenge</h1>
            <p>When someone tested positive for COVID-19, they would contact the Lexington-Fayette County Health Department. <b>The health department would take more than 48 hours to contact the school where the infected person worked.</b>  By that time, people who were close-contacts of that person had already talked to up to dozens of people in the school and been in close proximity with them, increasing the risk of spreading COVID-19. Plus, <b>the infected person almost never remembered exactly who they were around while they were contagious. We needed a solution to drastically reduce the contact tracing time.</b>  </p>

            <h1>Role, Scope and Constraints</h1>
            <p>Public schools don't have big budgets for staffing. This meant that I had to be the <b>UX Designer, Researcher, Graphic Designer and Developer all at once.</b> Plus, this was my first mobile application that I had made! <b>The goal was to create a QR-code based mobile application</b> that would allow people to scan in out of rooms, and send that information to a backend database that principals and school leaders could access if there was a COVID-19 case. Principals could look up who was around the individual during the time they were infected and have them quarantine to keep the building safe. <b>I called it a proactive contact tracing system, which was faster and more efficient </b>than the health department's system, which was retroactive and depended on the infected person's memory. </p>

            <p>Along with mask-wearing, the Scan Space app helped reduce the spread of COVID-19 by reducing the contact-tracing process in school from 48 hours to about 4 minutes.</p>

            <h1>Results</h1>
            <p>Through the Scan Space mobile application and contact tracing system, we <b>increased positive attitudes towards returning to school and decreased the contact tracing time by over 10,000% (from ~48 hours to ~4 minutes)</b> </p>

            <h1>Process</h1>
            <p><b>Interviews</b> were essential to create the perfect solution for this problem. From C-Suite execs to classroom teachers, I needed to get their feedback to create a unique solution that would work for everyone. <b>Quantitative research</b> was a key next step, because I was able to accurately assess the discrepancies that caused issues in the health departments process. After aggregating the data, I collaborated with the Director of Technology and created <b>wireframes, mockups and prototypes</b> of the app and conducted <b>user testing</b> to see what painpoints existed for users. I got a ton of great feedback and I was able to conduct additional <b>usability testing</b> to complete the design. After launch, <b>user feedback</b> led to various improvements. </p>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>We were the only school district in Kentucky to implement a system of this complexity (to our knowledge). While other schools had major, district-wide shutdowns due to COVID-19, we were able to <b>eliminate district wide shut-downs, decrease interruptions in the learning process and save public tax dollars.</b></p>

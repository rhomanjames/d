            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>North American Plastics, the number one distributor of wholesale plastics in the US and Canada, needed a corporate site makeover. Their previous site was quickly made, without the user in the forefront of design decisions. Information was difficult to find, the appearance was outdated and their digital presence didn't match their in-person reputation. I wanted to change that through intentional, user-focused design. </p>

            <h1>Strategy</h1>
            <p>On most plastics companies sites, they a have tons of pictures of plastic, but none of actual people. The lack of human presence on the websites made for a drab and uniform look across plastic companies. I wanted to change the narrative by highlighting the diversity within the company. As recruitment efforts ramped up and future acquisitions were pending, highlighting a human presence on the site to increase engagement and personability was essential. The CEO expressed to me that he didn't want to just look like another "corporate" site. He wanted NAP to feel like a fun place to work and a great company to work with.</p>

            <h1>Challenge</h1>
            <p>North American Plastics is the number one wholesale distributor of plastic, but they're not very popular. Their web presence definitely did not show them as the leader in the industry due to the unjustified design decisions and outdated look. I wanted to truly make them look like the number one plastics distributor through their web presence, and not just their sales numbers.</p>

            <h1>Role, Scope and Constraints</h1>
            <p>I served as the UX lead on this project, but I was also responsible for developing the site. I initially wanted to use React JS to build the site, but since we would not have any addition developer support, I decided to go with Wordpress to simplify future editing. Also, as the only UX Designer, I didn't have anyone else to bounce ideas off of, but I was able to do some competitive analysis and utilize research from our researchers to create a clean, usable product.</p>

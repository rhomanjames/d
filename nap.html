            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>North American Plastics, the number one distributor of wholesale plastics in the US and Canada, needed a corporate site makeover.  <b>Their previous site was poorly made,</b> without the user in the forefront of design decisions. Information was difficult to find, the appearance was outdated and their digital presence didn't match their in-person reputation.<b>  I wanted to change that through intentional, user-focused design.</b> </p>

            <h1>Strategy</h1>
            <p><b>On most plastics companies sites, they a have tons of pictures of plastic,</b> but none of actual people. The lack of human presence on the websites made for a drab and uniform look across plastic companies. <b>I wanted to change the narrative by highlighting the people within the company. </b>As recruitment efforts ramped up and future acquisitions were pending, highlighting a human presence on the site to increase engagement and personability was essential. <b>The CEO expressed to me that he didn't want to just look like another "corporate" site. He wanted NAP to feel like a fun place to work and a great company to work with.</b></p>

            <h1>Challenge</h1>
            <p>Despite being the number one wholesale distributor of plastic, they're not very popular. <b>Their web presence definitely did not show them as the leader in the industry due to the unjustified design decisions and outdated look.</b> I wanted to truly make them look like the number one plastics distributor through their web presence, and not just their sales numbers. <b>I led with the idea that the top plastics company in the US should have the top plastics site in the US.</b></p>

            <h1>Role, Scope and Constraints</h1>
            <p>I served as the <b>UX lead on this project,</b> but I was also responsible for developing the site. I initially wanted to use React JS to build the site, but since we would not have any addition developer support, <b>I decided to go with Wordpress to simplify future editing.</b> Also, as the only UX Designer, I didn't have anyone else to bounce ideas off of, <b>but I was able to do some competitive analysis and utilize research from our researchers to create a clean, usable product.</b></p>

            <h1>Results</h1>
            <p>I was determined to accomplish three key goals: <b>(1) Give the site a modern, clean look</b> by using best-in-industry design practices. <b>(2)Replace pictures of plastic with people</b> because the corporate site wasn't a sales site, and users wanted to know more about the people at the company, not the plastic. <b>(3)Make information easy to find through intentional information architecture and hierarchy.</b></p>

            <h1>Process</h1>
            <p>I started off by <b>interview executives and users to see what they valued in a corporate site.</b> A few main aspects were, "a good place to work", "a great company to be acquired by" or "a great company to work with". I also completed a <b>competitive analysis</b> to see what competitor's were doing on their site, what worked and what fell short. I then <b>created a sitemap, mockup and prototype with Adobe XD </b>to complete user testing. <b>After applying the user feedback, I created the final design</b> and we went live. Since then, we've used user feedback to make multiple improvements to the site.</p>
